       "  'text': '**Ajay Nagar**, better known by his online alias **CarryMinati**, is a prominent Indian YouTuber, streamer, and social media personality from Faridabad, India.\\n\\nHe is widely considered one of the most influential digital creators in India. Here are the key facts about him:\\n\\n### 1. Rise to Fame\\nAjay started his YouTube journey at the age of 10. He initially posted football tutorials and later moved to gaming videos and mimicry (specifically of Sunny Deol). He eventually found his niche in **\"roasting\"**—a style of video where he provides satirical and often aggressive commentary on viral videos, social media trends, and other internet personalities.\\n\\n### 2. YouTube Channels\\n*   **CarryMinati:** This is his main channel, where he posts his highly produced comedy skits and roast videos. As of 2024, he is the **most-subscribed individual YouTuber in India** (and Asia), with over 40 million subscribers.\\n*   **CarryIsLive:** This is his second channel, dedicated to live-streaming games (like PUBG, GTA V, and Minecraft) and interacting with his fans in a more casual setting.\\n\\n### 3. The \"YouTube vs TikTok\" Controversy\\nIn 2020, Ajay became the center of a massive internet trend after he posted a video titled \"YouTube vs TikTok: The End.\" The video went viral globally, breaking several records for likes and views, before it was removed by YouTube for violating \"terms of service\" regarding harassment. The incident sparked a massive debate about content creator rights and significantly boosted his popularity.\\n\\n### 4. Style and Impact\\n*   **Unique Delivery:** He is known for his signature Hindi catchphrases, raspy voice, and high-energy delivery.\\n*   **Music:** He has also ventured into music, releasing several rap tracks like \"Yalgaar\" (which was a response to the TikTok controversy), \"Vardaan,\" and \"Zindagi.\"\\n\\n### 5. Recognition\\n*   In 2019, he was featured in **TIME Magazine’s \"Next Generation Leaders\"** list, which highlights young people who are changing the world.\\n*   He has won several awards and made a cameo appearance in the 2022 Bollywood movie *Runway 34*, playing himself.\\n\\nIn short, Ajay Nagar is a pioneer of the roasting culture on the Indian internet and remains one of the most powerful voices in the country\\'s digital entertainment space.',\n",
