    "2. What is the main purpose of the 'attention mechanism' as described in the video?\n",

    "> To convert human-readable text into a numerical format that computers can process.\n",

    "> Each token is assigned a unique number (a token ID) from the model's dictionary.\n",
    "6. Based on the demonstration in the video, what is true about the token IDs generated for the same text by different models like GPT-3 and GPT-4?\n",

    "### 1. Transformer Architecture\n",
    "> **Core Role:** Shifts from sequential (RNN) to parallel processing. Uses **Self-Attention** to model long-range dependencies across the entire sequence simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Attention Mechanism\n",
    "> **Function:** Assigns **relevance weights** to input tokens. It determines how much focus the model puts on specific past tokens when predicting the next one, solving the \"vanishing gradient\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Iterative Generation\n",
    "> **Process:** LLMs are **autoregressive**. They generate one token at a time, calculating a probability distribution for the next token, appending it to the context, and repeating the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tokenization\n",
    "> **Why:** Neural nets need numbers, not text. Tokenization (via algorithms like **BPE**) breaks text into discrete units to balance vocabulary size and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Post-Tokenization Step\n",
    "> **Mechanism:** Token IDs are immediately passed to an **Embedding Layer**, converting integers into dense, high-dimensional vectors that encode semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Token ID Consistency\n",
    "> **Verdict:** No. Tokenization is architecture-specific. Different models (GPT-4 vs. LLaMA) use different vocabularies, meaning the same text yields different IDs and counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Context Window\n",
    "> **Definition:** The **finite memory buffer** (Input + History + Output) available for a single inference pass. Compute often scales quadratically with this length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. API Cost Calculation\n",
    "> **Formula:** Billing is based on **Total Throughput**: (Prompt/Input Tokens) + (Completion/Output Tokens). Output tokens are usually more expensive (compute-heavy).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. max_tokens Parameter\n",
    "> **Purpose:** A production safeguard. It sets a \"hard stop\" on the generation loop to control **latency**, prevent hallucination loops, and manage API budget."
